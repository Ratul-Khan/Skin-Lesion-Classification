# Skin-Lesion-Classification
The study investigates the application of deep learning
techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in the automated classification of skin lesions for early detection of skin diseases.For the
recognition network, lesions are classified into multiple classes using an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19 and InceptionV3 against three datasets, namely, HAM10000, ISIC-2016
and ISIC-2019 datasets.Initially, rebalancing and augmentation of the skin images are performed. Then classification is done through ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks.
The proposed ensemble method demonstrates praiseworthy success in lesion recognition.
